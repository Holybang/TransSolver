INTRODUCTION

TransSolver is a lib which implements algorithms to compute different types of transformation from corresponding points. Currently, this lib supports affine, similarity and rigid transformation. 

Read [1] for details of the implemented algorithms.

INSTALLATION

OpenCV(any version) is needed.
